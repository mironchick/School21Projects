### Certifications
Whether you are new or already established in the testing profession, ISTQB® certification will support you throughout your career. For employers, the ISTQB® Certified Tester scheme will help you to develop and validate the skills in your team, and support recruitment. ISTQB® certifications offer Training Providers multiple opportunities to extend their training course portfolios. Click on each certification for more information.

### SCR
Certificate holders meeting the search criteria will be listed with an anonymized certificate number meaning some digits are replaced by ***. This feature allows ISTQB® to protect the certificate number from being misused but gives enough information to verify a certificate number that an individual has provided.  
Inclusion is voluntary so not all certification holders may be included. The register is updated regularly but please allow some time for your details to appear – if you have any concerns please contact your certificate issuer. Individuals that obtained an ISTQB® certification before January 2017 may not yet be listed. Please contact the certification body (ISTQB® Member Board or Exam Provider) who issued your certificate for information on how to be added (note: terms and conditions may vary by Board/ Exam Provider).

### Glossary
The ISTQB® glossary contains 604 terms with detailed descriptions. It will be useful, for example, in standardizing terminology in the team and writing test documentation.
